Personal Notes : As a game designer, I always wanted to make a game that has my art & music assets, and this game is the one. Although there are some regrets and fights between team members, I pretty much love the outcome.
	           I learned that I should never just anticipate someone to do certain work, because they might not really notice about it. In next project, I will make clear for team members what is our goal and to achieve that goal, what each memeber should do.
	           I also learned how powerful and dangerous the C++ is. It is definitely worth studying, and I really like this language! Special thanks to those who encouraged me to keep work while having a hard time!
