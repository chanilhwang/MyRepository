Personal Notes: I though I've done a lot of jobs as a producer mostly about "communication". However, I realized that small teams do not need communicator. Furthermore, I regret that I hesitated to ask my team members even though I had a lot of things to finish quickly if I had asked about minor things.
		Even though, we had a hard times to makes a game, I am relatively satisfied with the result. Especially, I think this game was a game that every team member wants to make. It was a great works that everyone spent a lot of time adjusting things what we want!
		I am saddened by the fact that I spent too much time in the parts other than coding. Personally, I would like to be able to focus on the code in the next semester.
